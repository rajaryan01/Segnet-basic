What is SegNet-Basic?

"In order to analyse SegNet and compare its performance with FCN (decoder variants) we use a smaller version of SegNet, termed SegNet-Basic , which ha 4 encoders and 4 decoders. All the encoders in SegNet-Basic perform max-pooling and subsampling and the corresponding decoders upsample its input using the received max-pooling indices."
Basically it's a mini-segnet to experiment / test the architecure with convnets, such as FCN.
